### Lorenz Attractor

The Lorenz system is a system of ordinary differential equations first studied by mathematician and meteorologist Edward Lorenz. It is notable for having chaotic solutions for certain parameter values and initial conditions. In particular, the Lorenz attractor is a set of chaotic solutions of the Lorenz system. <br>
<br>
In popular media the "butterfly effect" stems from the real-world implications of the Lorenz attractor, namely that several different initial chaotic conditions evolve in phase space in a way that never repeats, so all chaos is unpredictable. <br>
<br>This underscores that chaotic systems can be completely deterministic and yet still be inherently unpredictable over long periods of time. Because chaos continually increases in systems, we cannot predict the future of systems well. e.g., even the small flap of a butterfly’s wings could set the world on a vastly different trajectory, such as by causing a hurricane. <br>
<br>The shape of the Lorenz attractor itself, when plotted in phase space, may also be seen to resemble a butterfly.

*'The idea that small, seemingly trivial events may ultimately result in something with much larger consequences'*
### Lorenz model

The model is a system of three ordinary differential equations now known as the Lorenz equations:

The equations relate the properties of a two-dimensional fluid layer uniformly warmed from below and cooled from above. In particular, the equations describe the rate of change of three quantities with respect to time: <br>
- x is proportional to the rate of convection
- y to the horizontal temperature variation
- z to the vertical temperature variation.<br>

The constants σ, ρ, and β are system parameters proportional to the Prandtl number, Rayleigh number, and certain physical dimensions of the layer itself.<br>

One normally assumes that the parameters σ, ρ, and β are positive. Lorenz used the values σ = 10, β = 8/3 and ρ = 28. The system exhibits chaotic behavior for these (and nearby) values.
